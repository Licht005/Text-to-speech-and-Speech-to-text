# Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text Python Script

This Python script provides a simple way to convert **text to speech** (TTS) and **speech to text** (STT). Using the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library for TTS and the `SpeechRecognition` library for STT, this project allows you to either input text and have it spoken out loud or speak and have the system convert your speech into text.

## Features

- **Text to Speech**: Convert any text into speech in multiple languages.
- **Speech to Text**: Speak into the microphone and get your speech converted to text.
- **Customizable Voice**: Choose from multiple voices and languages for the text-to-speech feature.

## Requirements

Before running the script, you need to install the following libraries:

- `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech)
- `SpeechRecognition`

The libraries can be installed via `pip` (Python's package installer).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or **Download the script** to your local machine.

2. **Install the required dependencies** by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install gtts
pip install SpeechRecognition
